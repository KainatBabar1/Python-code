This project features Python code written in Jupyter notebooks, following best practices aimed at producing clean, maintainable, and reproducible work.

- **Readable Code:** Clear variable names, concise functions, and meaningful comments make the code easy to understand.
- **Modular Design:** Code is organized into reusable cells and functions, promoting modularity and ease of debugging.
- **Documentation:** Markdown cells provide explanations, usage instructions, and context to enhance notebook readability and collaboration.
- **Version Control:** Notebooks are tracked with Git to maintain transparent code evolution and facilitate teamwork.
- **Environment Management:** Virtual environments or containers ensure consistent dependencies and smooth execution across systems.
- **Data Handling:** Data loading, preprocessing, and visualization are carefully performed for effective exploratory data analysis.
- **Testing and Validation:** Outputs are validated at every step using assertions or tests to ensure result reliability.
- **Performance Considerations:** Computation-heavy tasks are optimized through profiling, vectorized operations, or parallel processing.
- **Execution Order:** Notebooks are run sequentially from top to bottom to ensure reproducibility and avoid hidden state errors.
- **Clear Outputs:** Clearing cell outputs before commits helps keep notebooks clean and prevents stale output confusion.

This approach combines the interactive strengths of Jupyter notebooks with professional software engineering standards to create high-quality, shareable, and robust projects.
